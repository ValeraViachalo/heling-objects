  "aboutProduct": "The minimalist ARC-F4 side table is reminiscent of monumental triumphal arches. Where the shuttering board yellow glowing multipotential furniture makes its way into life, it becomes practical, visual and felt indispensable. Design Highlight ARC-F4 is available as a side table and as an upholstered stool. ARC-F4 stands for 4 arches made of spruce, sure instinct and pure handwork. The shapes of the 4 triumphal arches are pre-drilled into 9 planed spruce beams, then chiselled out piece by piece with hammer and chisel and - when all the hammer blows are precisely in place - sanded smooth all around. Finally, the beams are glued 3 x 3 and stained yellow."
