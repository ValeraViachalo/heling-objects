  "aboutProduct": "The Neapolitan city gate Porta Nolana gave the idea for the PONTI coffee table. An elegant minimalist, harmoniously playing with exciting contrasts, with sensual wood and plain steel, grounding and lightness. PONTI is available in ash or walnut and 5 plain colours for the table top. The designer adapts the architectural fort components, flank towers and archways into an elongated cone with a seemingly floating tabletop. All wooden elements are created with manual cooperage skills on the artist's own lathe. The hand-oiled corpus and powdered steel plate are invisibly screwed together. PONTI side table is limited to 50 pieces per colour and exclusively available in the shop of HEILIG OBJECTS."
