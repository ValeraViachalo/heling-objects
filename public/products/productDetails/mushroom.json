  "aboutProduct": "MUSHROOM-FS lives from a refreshingly interpreted cooperage tradition. The minimalist dining table stands on a sensationally beautifully crafted base. Its elegantly floating tabletop is the social centrepiece. MUSHROOM-FS is available in black ash, natural ash and as a PS side table. MUSHROOM-FS is handcrafted and the art of woodturning. The round table top with 120 cm radius and Swiss edge. 18 solid oak staves, which four powerful hands shape into a 70 cm high barrel, glue together, clamp dry in the lathe and iteratively turn perfectly round. Finally, the cone and top are sanded, stained black and oiled matt."
