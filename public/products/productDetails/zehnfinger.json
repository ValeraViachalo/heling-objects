  "aboutProduct": "Daniel Heilig translates the spectacular ceiling architecture of the Tomba Brion by Carlo Scarpa into THRONE. The breathtaking furniture architecture animates every interior, as a multifaceted life companion and contemplative work of art. THRONE is available as a stool and side table. For THRONE, the designer deliberately chooses old ash wood with a strikingly dark brown core. The organic colour spectrum of natural ash and the precise gradations of the carcase architecture interact with light and shadow. This creates unique, magical patterns that always surprise and invite meditative contemplation."
