  "aboutProduct": "The Church of Light by architecture autodidact Tadao And≈ç inspires design autodidact Daniel Heilig to create OHUS. The mobile furniture is a multifunctional design oasis for modern nomads. And modular good-humour furniture in busy spaces. OHUS is available as a stool and bench. OHUS is the first furniture design by Daniel Heilig that can be easily assembled or disassembled, transported in only 3 individual parts or stored in a space-saving way. The intelligent design concept, the radical visual and formal independent composition, as well as the interplay of ash wood, steel and signal colour are pure innovation."
